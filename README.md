# Baking App: Udacity (Android Devloper Nanodegree)

<body>
  <h3>Project Summary</h3>
  <p>This is an Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. 
  I created an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipe listing is located here (http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json).

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images for this app. 
Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills I demonstrated in this project is how to handle unexpected input in my data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.</p>
